# My very first website

Welcome to my very first website!

This website was built as part of the learning material for Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer programme.

You can check out the website [here](https://s-batish.github.io/my-full-template/index.html)!

## Project Description

This site was created in order to get familiar with common development tools like Git and GitHub, and how to use them to write and manage code. The project will display a breakdown of the different technologies used in each of the different sections of the programme.

## Technology

This project was written in HTML & CSS and is currently hosted on GitHub pages.
